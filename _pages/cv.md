  Advisor: Dr. Jing Wang

# Reaserch Interests
+ The interplay between dark matter halo, galaxy and supermassive black hole
+ The quenching mechanisms of galaxies
+ The morphology, structure, and kinematics of galaxies
+ Mechine learning and data driven discovery in astronomy

# Reaserch Skills
+ Extensive experience in applying machine learning algorithms in astronomy, including:
  + Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
  + Convolutional Neural Networks
  + Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders
  + Diffusion models. For the first time, developed a novel method to generate resolved kinematics and mass distribution from multi-band imaging using diffusion models.
